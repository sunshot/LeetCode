# 876. Middle of the Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/

Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: Node 3 from this list (Serialization: [3,4,5])
The returned node has value 3.  (The judge's serialization of this node is [3,4,5]).
Note that we returned a ListNode object ans, such that:
ans.val = 3, ans.next.val = 4, ans.next.next.val = 5, and ans.next.next.next = NULL.
```

重点：弄清楚起始 fast 是 head 还是 head.next，根据需要而定，本地需要指向 head
